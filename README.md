# Treehouse Project 1 - Random Quote Generator
First Project in Full Stack Tech Degree Program. This project is a site that generates a random quote chosen from a list and displays it on the page.
 
 # Motivation
Motivation behind this project is to finally learn more about programming.  I have toyed with the idea for a long time now and am at a crossroads in my career right now.  I need to decide if I want to commit down becoming a developer or stay on my current path within IT.  Going through the Tech Degree program will hopefully get me my answer.
